Peripheral is a framework which supports peripheral display designers extensively by reducing their workload to the essential. Our goal is to enable a designer to create performant and esthetically pleasing peripheral displays without writing a single line of code.

Therefor, a grahical user interface is getting developed, which can be used to graphically support the creation of a peripheral display theme. Furthermore rules and actions can be added to the theme's graphical elements through a powerful rule engine. The framework currently supports dynamic and remote wrapping of IEEE 1451.0 compliant sensors that are connected to a JDDACServer, as well as the wrapping and implementation of novel sensors.

The system architecture is defined by a designer gui, one or more remote visualizations, a rule engine, multiple sensors connected to multiple sensor servers. XML is used as configuration and data interchange format within various system modules.

The peripheral framework is getting developed by two graduate and two undergraduate students at the JKU Linz, Austria within the scope of the Masterprogram Pervasive Computing.
