#summary Tutorial on how to implement your own sensors (probes) and run them on a JddacClient

= Prerequisites =

  # Download [http://jddac.labs.agilent.com/jddac/downloads/jddac-1.3-src.zip JDDAC Framework]
  # Compile the JddacClient by invoking `ant` in the clients root dir: `/apps/JddacClient/` or by compiling the whole JDDAC Framework at once by invoking `ant` in the framworks root directory
  # Read through the documentation provided with JDDAC to get familiar with the IEEE 1451.0 standard

= Writing your own transducer block =
To write your own basic sensor, a new class needs to be added to the package `net.java.jddac.jmdi.transducers`, where you can already find the demo transducers provided by JDDAC. By taking a look on the existing transducers, one can see that writing your own transducers is a pretty simple task.
