#summary Instructions to set up all PDC components correctly

Allthough all PDC components such as the Peripheral Display Creator and Visualization are executable with setting any prior modifcations of your runtime environment. The only prerequisite is an installed Java VM running JRE 1.5, which can be considered as "standard configuration" nowadays. 

As PDC uses the JDDAC Framework for sensor management, access to a running JDDAC Server is needed. If you do not have this access you might want to download and setup your own server installation, as well as implement own probes and attach them to your own server. To do so, read through the following steps.

==JDDAC Framework==

JDDAC (Java Distributed Data Acquisition and Control) is a platform for building sensor networks and data acquisition systems. JDDAC enables Java applications to interact with the physical world by providing the means to manage transducers and to access measurement data streams. JDDAC is based on the IEEE 1451 standards for smart transducers, and it is available for the J2ME, J2SE, and J2EE environments.

If you are eager to set up your own sensorserver or do not have access to an exsiting one, download the framework from the project website:
